# Image-Processing

Abstract:
We can learn from this project that it studies the (CNN) Convolutional Neural 
Networks and how it is affected when we implement CNN on the colored images. 
We are predicting this for every leaf class on the leaf snap using CNN in the 
dataset that we gathered from the Kaggle website, which are available publicly. 
All the leaf images from the dataset were segmented using an automatic mean 
thresholding technique in order to create binary images, also masking was applied 
for the color images to separate it from green leaf pixels apart from the 
background

Introduction:
The goal of the project is to determine if adding the color to the leaf classification 
problem could prove beneficial. Since, leaf classification are considered to be 
popular among the computer vision sides, if we are able to make an individual to 
name the plant species based on the images alone, that could prove beneficial.
Under the background section which discuses about the papers that we used in 
terms for reference tells us that the researches excluded the color of the leaves 
during the analysis even when some of the plants showed different shades of 
green in them
